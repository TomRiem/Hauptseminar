The property of quadratic termination has been replaced by one of monotonic convergence of the eigenvalues of the approximating matrix to the inverse Hessian. A convex class of updating formulae which possess this property has been established, and a strategy has been indicated for choosing a member of the class so as to keep the approximation away from both singularity and unboundedness. A FORTRAN program has been tested extensively with encouraging results.}},

This paper presents a class of approximating matrices as a function of a scalar parameter. The problem of optimal conditioning of these matrices under an appropriate norm as a function of the scalar parameter is investigated. A set of computational results verifies the superiority of the new methods arising from conditioning considerations to known methods.},

  abstract={In this paper, a Riemannian BFGS method is defined for minimizing a smooth function on a Riemannian manifold endowed with a retraction and a vector transport. The method is based on a Riemannian generalization of a cautious update and a weak line search condition. It is shown that, the Riemannian BFGS method converges (i) globally to a stationary point without assuming that the objective function is convex and (ii) superlinearly to a nondegenerate minimizer. The weak line search condition removes completely the need to consider the differentiated retraction. The joint diagonalization problem is used to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm with various parameters, line search conditions, and pairs of retraction and vector transport.},

  abstract = 	 {Geodesic convexity generalizes the notion of (vector space) convexity to nonlinear metric spaces. But unlike convex optimization, geodesically convex (g-convex) optimization is much less developed. In this paper we contribute to the understanding of g-convex optimization by developing iteration complexity analysis for several first-order algorithms on Hadamard manifolds. Specifically, we prove upper bounds for the global complexity of deterministic and stochastic (sub)gradient methods for optimizing smooth and nonsmooth g-convex functions, both with and without strong g-convexity. Our analysis also reveals how the manifold geometry, especially \emphsectional curvature, impacts convergence rates. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide global complexity analysis for first-order algorithms for general g-convex optimization.}
