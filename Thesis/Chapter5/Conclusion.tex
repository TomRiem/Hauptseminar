\chapter{Conclusion}

This work summarizes how the SR1 update for matrices can be generalized to a self-adjoint rank-one update for operators on a tangent space within a Riemannian Trust-Region approach. The corresponding update was implemented for use in the already existing Trust-Region method in the package \lstinline!Manopt.jl!. An experiment was conducted in the programming language Julia in which was found that the RTR-SR1 method works, but for the chosen problem the RTR-SR1 method could not prove to be faster than the RTR-Newton method, which however requires the action of the Hessian operator. Nevertheless, there is further interest in investigating
