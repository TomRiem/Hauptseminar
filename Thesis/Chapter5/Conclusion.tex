\chapter{Conclusion}

This work summarizes how the SR1 update for matrices can be generalized to a self-adjoint rank-one update for operators on a tangent space within a Riemannian Trust-Region approach. The corresponding update was implemented in the package \lstinline!Manopt.jl! for use in the already existing Trust-Region method. An experiment was conducted in the programming language Julia in which was found that the RTR-SR1 method converges for the chosen optimization problem, but not as fast or efficient as the RTR-Newton method.
