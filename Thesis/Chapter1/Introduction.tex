\chapter{Introduction}

Optimization on Riemannian manifolds, also called Riemannian optimization, concerns finding an optimum of a real-valued function $f$ defined over a manifold. It can be thought of as unconstrained optimization on a constrained space. \\

It is shown how the SR1 update is generalized for operators on the tangent space of a manifold and the performance of a Riemannian SR1 quasi-Newton method implemented in the package \lstinline!Manopt.jl! (available at \url{https://manoptjl.org}, \cite{Bergmann:2019}) is compared with that of a Riemannian BFGS method.
